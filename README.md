### Jeopardy game clone

This project is a simple implementation of the classic TV game show "Jeopardy". The project is built using vanilla JavaScript, which means it doesn't rely on any additional frameworks or libraries. (Except sweetalert, which can be easily replaced with `confirm` for this project) 
 
However, with this project, I managed to develop and include my own versions of ReactJS (class components with state management), Observables, and Redux state in the simplest way possible.
