### Jeopardy game clone

Welcome to the Jeopardy Game Clone! This project is a simple implementation of the classic TV game show "Jeopardy". The project is built using vanilla JavaScript, which means it doesn't rely on any additional frameworks or libraries.
 
However, with this project, I managed to write and include my own versions of ReactJS, Observables, and Redux state in the simplest way possible.
